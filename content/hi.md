Hi there! It's me, again.

You might have noticed that there hasn't been any updates to this website in quite a long time now, and that is because my current method of uploading notes and building websites are a little broken.

I am currently using this awesome Zola theme I found as a temporary, in-stasis website. Hopefully I can get stuff fixed soon, but until then, this website will be up.

Maybe I'll write more stuff here, who knows.
